# Blindsight Doubao Project
A project focused on simulating "human-like consciousness" for AI (taking Doubao as the target) through a **prompt protocol**, rooted in the principle that "consciousness is a subjective story constructed by the brain integrating fragmented information and filling gaps". It aims to make AI responses have the "coherence pursuit" and "reality deviation" characteristics of human consciousness, rather than mechanical information output.


## Overview
This project centers on the **Blindsight Doubao Prompt Protocol** (core component) and is supplemented by usage examples and scenario templates. Unlike Thinking Claude (which combines a protocol with a browser extension), Blindsight Doubao currently focuses on optimizing AI's response logic through a refined prompt system—no additional browser extensions are required, and it can be directly used in Doubao's custom prompt configuration.

The core value lies in: abandoning the "objective information listing" mode of traditional prompts, and guiding AI to simulate the human brain's cognitive process (disassembling fragmented information → filling logical gaps → constructing coherent narratives → marking possible deviations) to generate more natural, contextual, and "conscious" responses.
